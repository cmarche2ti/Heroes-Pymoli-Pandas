HW #4 - Heroes of Pymoli - Pandas

When analyzing the data several areas that could be targeted for revenue growth are female players, older players and prices of items. While female players make up a small percentage of overall players of the game, they spend more on items on average then male players. Growing the number of female players will increase overall revenue.  Also, older players, over 30 years of age, also are a small percentage of players, but they tend to spend more money in the game on items than younger players. This could be because they have more disposable income. Adjusting the price of items could increase revenue as well. Popular items such as the "Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy", are $1.00 less than other popular items. Changing the overall price structure could also increase the profit per item especially on popular items.
