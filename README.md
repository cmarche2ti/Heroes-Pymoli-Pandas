HW #4 on Pandas

Three trends in the data that I observed are that female players represent a growth area for revenue. In the data female players make up a small percentage of overall players, but spend more on items on average then male players. Also, older players, over 30 years of age, are a smaller percentage of players, but they tend to spend more money in the game on items, possibly because they have more disposable income. Items could be priced differently so that more profit could be made by increasing prices of popular items such as the "Pursuit, Cudgel of Necromancy".
